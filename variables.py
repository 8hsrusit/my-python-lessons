# variables
# variables have rules such as:

# 1) you can't start with a number or a special character such as(!,@,#,$,%,^,&,*,(,),-,etc...)
# 2) you can start with a character (A-Z) or (Z-A) and underscore (_)
# 3) you can include a number (0-9) but you can't start with a number
# 4) you can't include any special character (!,@,#,$,%,^,&,*,(,),-, etc...)
# 5) you can't name the variables with syntax names like (print,class,if,elif.else.true,false,etc...)
# note ypu can use names like syntex if you do like this (iff,classs,pprint,eelif,etc...)
# note see the syntax names with help("keywords")
# note use the ("") if your var is str(word) and its not just with var but with all the syntex in py like print("hi") but don't but ("") if you want to print you var
# the correct way:

name = "BLX" 

print(name)

Name = "mahmood"

print(Name)

# note name and Name is a completly different varibles

# note you can use more than one var like:

a , c , b = 1, 2 ,3 

print(a)
print(c)
print(b)
