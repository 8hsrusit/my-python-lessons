# math in python
# you can use the print() syntax 
# do not use the "" or '' becuse its (int)interger or float
# for example:

# in plus:

print(3+5) # ITS 8 dont be so stupid

print(80+20) # ITS 100 dont be such a fool

# in minus

print(8-6) # ITS 2
print(6-8) #ITS -2

# in times 
# we use the * 

print(5*2) # ITS 10 you idoit

print(6*6) # ITS 36 you fool

# in devide 
# we use the /

print(4/2) # ITS 2

print(8/2) # ITS 4


# know how many times does the int have
# we use //

print(6//2) # the 6 have 3 2

print(4//2) # the 4 have 2 2
