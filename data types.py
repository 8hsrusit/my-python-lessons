#data types
# the syntax type() displays the data type you put in
# note you can use this syntax only with print()
# for example

print(type(1)) # data type => int(interger) in simple meaning => number


print(type(100)) # same thing => int(interger)


print(type(100.5)) # data type => float in simple meaning => decimal fraction


print(type(500.2)) # same thing => float


print(type("hello")) # data type => str => string in simple meaning => words


print(type("i love you")) # same thing => str

print(type([1 , 2, 3, 4])) # data type => list

print(type( (1,2 ,3 ,4) )) # data type => tuple

print(type({"one" : 1 , "two" : 2 , "three" : 3})) # data type => dict(dictionary) 
      
print(type(2 == 2)) # data type => boolean  in simple meaning => true oe false
