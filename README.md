# my-python-lessons

Hi ðŸ˜† I'm just a guy who loves programming.

I'm still at the beginning of this journey and learning Python step by step.  
I don't know very much about programming yet, so I'm sorry if you find something wrong.

All the files in this repo were made by me, with passion and curiosity!
