# *indexing & slicing
# its to get access to a part from the info you want
# use the syntax print(u_var[])
# you stert from zero, for ex {hello} h = 0 , e = 1 etc...
# the space is included as an object . for ex {i love you} i = 0  , space = 1  , l = 2 etc....

# the var we will use for learning

X = "i love python"

# ^^indexing^^
# indexing is taking one single object from the var or the info

print(X[0]) # i want the {i} so i will put zero to index **like i said python is zero based indexing & slidcing**

print(X[8]) # i wont the {y} so i will put 8 to indexing

#^^slicing^^
# slicing is taking a multiple objects
# the syntex is [start:end] **end is not included**

print(X[3:6]) # i want to take {ove} 3 is the start **start is included** and the is 6 **end is not included**

print(X[8:11]) # i want to take {yth} 8 is the start and the 11 is the end **space is included**
 

# ^^slicing(steps)^^
# the syntax is [start:end:steps]
# steps is how many steps to move
# for ex

print(X[8:11:2]) # it will move 2 steps each time

print(X[3:6:3]) # it will move 3 steps each time
